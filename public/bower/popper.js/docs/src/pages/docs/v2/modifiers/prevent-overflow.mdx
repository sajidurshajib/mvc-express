# Prevent Overflow

The `preventOverflow` modifier prevents the popper from being cut off by moving
it so that it stays visible within its boundary area.

<x-ad />

## Demo

The tooltip is prevented from overflowing its clipping container, even though
that won't center it anymore.

## Phase

`main`

## Options

```flow
type Options = {
  mainAxis: boolean, // true
  altAxis: boolean, // false
  padding: Padding, // 0
  boundary: Boundary, // "clippingParents"
  altBoundary: boolean, // false
  rootBoundary: RootBoundary, // "viewport"
  tether: boolean, // true
  tetherOffset: TetherOffset, // 0
};

// Below are the described relative types
type TetherOffset =
  | (({
      popper: Rect,
      reference: Rect,
      placement: Placement,
    }) => number)
  | number;
```

### `mainAxis`

For top and bottom placements, this is the `x`-axis. For left and right
placements, it is the `y`-axis.

By default, only this axis checked, which means if a popper with `bottom`
placement is overflowing on the right of its boundary area, it will be moved to
the left so that it doesn't get cut off.

This behavior can be disabled by setting it to `false`.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        mainAxis: false, // true by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `altAxis`

Optionally, the alternative axis check can be enabled. Keep in mind that this
may cause the popper to overlap its reference element. Generally, the `flip`
modifier is used to prevent this from happening.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        altAxis: true, // false by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `padding`

See [`padding` in Detect Overflow](../../utils/detect-overflow/#padding) for
details.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        padding: 8,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `boundary`

See [`boundary` in Detect Overflow](../../utils/detect-overflow/#boundary) for
details.

```js
const element = document.querySelector('#parentElement');

createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        boundary: element,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `altBoundary`

This will check the reference's boundary context
([`clippingParents`](../../utils/detect-overflow/#boundary)) instead of the
popper's, effectively replicating the
[`scrollParent`](../../../v1/#preventoverflowboundarieselement) boundary from
Popper v1. See
[`altBoundary` in Detect Overflow](../../utils/detect-overflow/#altboundary) for
details.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        altBoundary: true, // false by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `rootBoundary`

See
[`rootBoundary` in Detect Overflow](../../utils/detect-overflow/#rootboundary)
for details.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        rootBoundary: 'document',
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `tether`

While trying to keep the popper element within its overflow area is usually
desired, we likely don't want to reach the point where the reference and popper
elements are not touching (or "tethered") to each other at all, since that would
make it difficult for the user to understand where the popper originated from.

The default behavior is to avoid this situation by allowing the popper to
overflow once the opposite edges of the reference element and popper element are
aligned (i.e. right before they would appear to be detached).

This behavior can be disabled by setting it to `false`:

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        tether: false, // true by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### `tetherOffset`

When `tether` is enabled, you can customize its behavior by providing an offset
to be used during the `tether` calculations. Setting the offset to a positive
number will make the tether behavior activate earlier, while setting it negative
will do the opposite.

The `tetherOffset` option can also take a function, this will enable you to read
some useful data, such as the popper and reference measures, or the current
popper placement:

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        tetherOffset: ({ popper, reference, placement }) => popper.width / 2,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Data

```flow
// Describes how much the Popper has been moved from its desired position so
// that it doesn't overflow
type Data = {
  x: number,
  y: number,
};
```
