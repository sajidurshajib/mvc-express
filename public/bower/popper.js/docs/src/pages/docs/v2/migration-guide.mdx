# Migrating to Popper 2

Popper 2 introduces a lot of changes for the better! Here's a guide to help you
migrate to the new version.

<x-ad />

## 1. Install the new package

Remove the `popper.js` package from your `package.json` or CDN script tag
includes, and install `@popperjs/core`.

Popper has changed its package name to live under the scoped `@popperjs`
organization. This is where other packages like `react-popper` will now live
too.

## 2. Change the import

### Modules

In Popper 1, it was a class:

```js
import Popper from 'popper.js';

new Popper(reference, popper, options);
```

In Popper 2, it's now a function:

```js
import { createPopper } from '@popperjs/core';

createPopper(reference, popper, options);
```

### CDN / `umd` version

This named import lives under the `Popper` namespace object:

```js
Popper.createPopper;
```

## 3. Change your CSS attribute selectors

In v1, attributes were prefixed with `x-`, for example, `x-placement`. In v2,
these are now prefixed with `data-popper-`, which matches the HTML5 spec, and
has its own data namespace to prevent conflicts.

Also, `x-out-of-boundaries` is now `data-popper-reference-hidden`.

## 4. Remove all CSS margins

In Popper 2 we no longer consider CSS `margin` because of inherent issues with
it. Instead, to apply some padding between the popper and its reference element,
use the `offset` modifier. You also need to remove `margin` from your arrows
too; instead use the `padding` option in the `arrow` modifier.

## 5. Ensure your popper and arrow box size is constant for all placements

Your popper and arrow cannot be a different width or height for different
placements; it must be constant in size. This is due to the way the Popper
lifecycle works â€“ which can't know ahead of time (before writing to the DOM)
what the computed CSS will be, which can change the size of the elements. In
Popper 1, this caused all sorts of flicker and jitter issues.

We are looking into a way to allow this in the future, but it's currently a
difficult problem to solve efficiently.

## 6. Add back boundary paddings if necessary

In Popper 2, all `padding` is now `0`. In v1, these were `5` for
`preventOverflow` and `flip`. If necessary, you can add these back using the
`padding` option, which works the same as v1.

## 7. Change `positionFixed`

In Popper 2, this is now the `strategy` option:

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  strategy: 'fixed',
});
```

## 8. Update method names

- `scheduleUpdate()` is now `update()` (and returns a promise)
- `update()` is now `forceUpdate()` (and is sync)
- `enableEventListeners` / `disableEventListeners` are gone; see the
  `eventListeners` modifier. You can use the `setOptions` method to change the
  `scroll` and `resize` options at will to replicate the original methods'
  functionality.

## 9. Update callbacks

- `onCreate` is now `onFirstUpdate`
- `onUpdate` is gone; use a custom modifier with an `afterWrite` phase

## 10. Update modifiers

In Popper 2 this is now an array of objects (modifiers), instead of an object
where each property was the modifier name.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'flip',
      enabled: false,
    },
  ],
});
```

In addition, their options are grouped together in the `options` object:

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'flip',
      options: {
        padding: 5,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

We cannot list all the changes to them here (there are a lot!); you'll need to
visit each modifier in the menu to learn more about their new behavior.

See [Modifiers](../modifiers/) for more information on writing custom modifiers.

## 11. `inner`, `keepTogether`, `shift` modifiers are gone

- `inner` can be replicated using the `offset` modifier with negative values
- `keepTogether` functionality lives in `preventOverflow` in `tether` options

## 12. Remove virtual element properties

The only property your virtual elements (or Reference Objects in Popper 1) need
is `getBoundingClientRect`. The other properties are unnecessary now.

## 13. Transitions

In Popper 2, the `computeStyles` modifier has a new option called `adaptive`
enabled by default, which breaks CSS transitions. You should set this option to
`false` if CSS transitions are enabled.

Keep in mind, `adaptive` has the benefit of allowing you to change the height or
width of the popper in most cases without needing to update its position, so
you'll lose this benefit when disabling it.
