# FAQ

Don't see your question here? Feel free to ask on
[Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/popper-js)! We'll try to answer you within a
day or two.

## Why is my popper in the wrong location (or not visible at all)?

For the `left` and `top` placements, Popper relies on HTML Standards Mode for
the `computeStyles` modifier's `adaptive` option. A problem will occur in Quirks
Mode when the `<body>` is the popper element's offsetParent, and it's taller
than the viewport.

To fix it, use the Standards Mode doctype:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <!-- ... -->
</html>
```

## Why is my popper jittering while scrolling?

If your reference element is `position: fixed`, use the `"fixed"` strategy:

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  strategy: 'fixed',
});
```

Due to the way browsers handle element updates, there will likely be some
inevitable stutters if the strategy does not match the reference element's
position.

## How do I add CSS transitions without disabling `adaptive`?

We recommend making the popper element a wrapper around an inner element that
can have any CSS property transitioned:

```html
<div class="popper">
  <div class="box">
    Content
  </div>
</div>
```

In the above case, the `.popper` element is the one that's positioned but has no
styles applied. The `.box` element has all of the CSS styling and animations.

## How do I set modifier defaults and allow them to be overridden?

Modifiers are merged by name, where later items in the array override earlier
ones. This provides a way to configure some defaults for modifiers, but allow
them to be overridden easily:

```js
// A user passes this object in:
const popperOptions = {
  strategy: 'fixed',
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        padding: 0,
      },
    },
  ],
};

// Your library sets its own defaults:
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  ...popperOptions,
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'preventOverflow',
      options: {
        rootBoundary: 'document',
        padding: 10,
      },
    },
    ...(popperOptions.modifiers || []),
  ],
});
```

## How do I change `offset` based on the browser width (media queries)?

Popper doesn't accept margins, but you can still make offset dynamic based on
media queries.

`window.matchMedia()` is a useful API for this â€” since `offset` can take a
function, it allows you to dynamically change the offset based on a condition:

```js
const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(max-width: 500px)');

createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'offset',
      options: {
        // 0px distance at <= 500px width, otherwise 10px distance
        offset: () => [0, mediaQuery.matches ? 0 : 10],
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## My popper is bigger than the viewport, what do I do?

Here are some options:

- Prevent the popper's width from ever exceeding the browser's width with
  `max-width: 100vw;` CSS (along with `box-sizing: border-box`).
- Set `preventOverflow`'s `rootBoundary` option to `document` if it must be
  larger than the viewport.
- Create a custom `size` modifier that changes the size of the popper based on
  the available space remaining, and allow the popper box to be scrolled. The
  `detectOverflow` utility enables this.
