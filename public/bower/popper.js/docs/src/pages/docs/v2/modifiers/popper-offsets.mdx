# Popper Offsets

The `popperOffsets` modifier is at the core of Popper, it computes the offsets
needed to position the popper element near the reference element.

In other words, without this modifier you would have no reason to use Popper at
all ðŸ˜„

This piece of logic is written as a modifier because it makes it possible to run
additional custom modifiers before it, for example, if you need to read from the
DOM and manipulate the measurements made by Popper at the beginning of the
lifecycle.

Additionally, you may want to replace this modifier with your own one, to
address very specific cases not covered by the default one.
